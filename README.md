 ## Title: 
 
Node Readme Generator 
  
 ## Description: 

In this project, I used inquirer within my index.js to create questions to fill out a READme within node. This included sections of: Title, Description, Installation, Usage, Contribution, Tests, License, and Questions. Once the questions are filled in, they are displayed on a new READme by requiring and using file system. There are premade titles within the markdown that will always appear on the final readme. Underneath these titles are the variables that pertain to each input the user fills in. The new information will be placed in that spot. There is also a license badge that can be selected for the readme. This was done through an if statement that returns a specific image based on the selection of either badge. The README's table of contents is also clickable. If one selects any section name, they will be redirected to that part of the page. This was done by placing id's next to each section within the markdown.
